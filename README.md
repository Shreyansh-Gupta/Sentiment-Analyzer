# Sentiment-Analyzer - *Mental Health Analysis during pandemic using Tweets With AI*. 

Recently, while participating in a hackathon ( **Spotle AI-thon Round-III** ) I made a Sentiment Analyzer using an AI model and basic concepts of NLP, from **Tweets** ( Twitter ) for mental Health Analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic which also analyzed the **Emotional** balance in the lockdown among the crowd from world. At first I described the sentiments in the tweets about how much positive, neutral and negative people are in their tweets

followed by dividing them emotionally with many emotions including Happy, Sad, Anger, Lazy, Alone, Fearful and many more. The outcome which I found said, the top three emotions found overpowering others were Fear, Sad, Happy respectively.
